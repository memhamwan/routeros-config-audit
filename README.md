# RouterOS Config Audit

## What is this?

This repository is a snapshot of all of our managed RouterOS devices from the `/export hide-sensitive` command. It is automatically generated and inteded as a read-only resource for netops users. Consider this an audit log for reference of our devices rather than a place to go and make changes.

## How does it work?

This information is autogenerated using an ansible role. Future tasks include writing automation to execute the role and commit the results -- today that is manually being done.
